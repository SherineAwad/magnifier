Magnifier 
============================================================

Magnifier is a snakemake  pipeline thathelp magnifies what are in your sample, check GC bias, coverage, etc. More ways of invetigating your samples will be included as we go. 
It takes sam file as input. Update config files for different with you samples names and other parameters. 

    snakemake -jn 

where n is the number of cores for example for 10 cores use:


    snakemake -j10 

### Use conda 

For less froodiness, use conda:


    snakemake -jn --use-conda 


For example, for 10 cores use: 

    snakemake -j10 --use-conda 

This will pull automatically the same versiosn of tools we used. Conda has to be installed in the system, in addition to snakemake. 


### Dry Run


For a dry run use: 
  
  
    snakemake -j1 -n 


and to print command in dry run use: 

  
    snakemake -j1 -n -p 


##### TODO 
1. Add more tools for invetigation
